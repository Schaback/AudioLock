# AudioLock - Lock Microphone Volume Level
Some applications on Windows feel like changing the volume level
of the input device in use.  

There seems to be no builtin way to deny them to.  
This tool does exactly that.

## Usage
1. Start the `AudioLock.exe`.
2. Select the inputs you want to be locked at the currently set level.

### Hint:
`AudioLock` minimizes to the system tray.
Right click the icon to set AutoStart.

## Known offenders
Not an exaustive list, just some examples:
- Tom Clancy's: Ghost Recon Wildlands, Far Cry 6  
(Thanks Ubisoft...)
- Some VOIP Software

## Not a solution
Disabling this setting might seem like it would do the job,
but there are plenty of applications where this does absolutely nothing.
